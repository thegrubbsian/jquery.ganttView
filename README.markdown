jQuery.ganttView
================

The jQuery.ganttView plugin is a very lightweight plugin for creating a Gantt chart in plain HTML...no vector graphics or images required.  The plugin supports dragging and resizing the Gantt blocks and callbacks to trap the updated data.

A title formatter and an hover event has been added in this fork. It will handle overlaps (static, not yet when blocks are moved).

The chart can also show Month/Year overviews besides the Day/Month views.

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
Currently the plugin has been tested, and is working in: FF 3.5+, Chrome 5+, Safari 4+, IE8+.  There are minor issues in IE7 and I haven't even attempted to use it in IE6.  If you encounter any issues with any version of Internet Explorer and would like to contribute CSS fixes please do so, several people have asked for IE6 support.


Dependencies
------------
The plugin depends on the following libraries:

- jQuery 1.4 or higher (obviously)
- jQuery-UI 1.8 or higher
- date.js


Documentation
-------------
(April 2014) We're starting a process to update the plugin, and will be adding documentation in parallel. So, stay tuned...


Contribution
------------
Oday Hazeem and Mohammed Zurba did most of the work for the added features.
