jQuery.ganttView
================

The jQuery.ganttView plugin is a very lightweight plugin for creating a Gantt chart in plain HTML...no vector graphics or images required.  The plugin supports dragging and resizing the Gantt blocks and callbacks to trap the updated data.

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
Currently the plugin has been tested, and is working in: FF 3.5+, Chrome 5+, Safari 4+, IE8+.  There are minor issues in IE7 and I haven't even attempted to use it in IE6.  If you encounter any issues with any version of Internet Explorer and would like to contribute CSS fixes please do so, several people have asked for IE6 support.


Dependencies
------------
The plugin depends on the following libraries:

- jQuery 1.4 or higher (obviously)
- jQuery-UI 1.8 or higher
- date.js


Documentation
-------------
(April 2014) We're starting a process to update the plugin, and will be adding documentation in parallel. So, stay tuned...


Contribution
------------
Many people have been asking for more advanced features such as variable time-span for the blocks (hours, weeks, etc.) as well as support for hierarchical items and multiple items per line.  While I would love to be able to add all of these features I just don't have the time and it's often not within the scope of why I created the plugin.  However, I would be extremely happy to accept any pull requests from anyone interested in adding these features.  If you like the plugin, feel free to fork it and submit your patches back.
